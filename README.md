# MakingConnections

<h1>Objectives</h1>

<ul>Add <b>JavaScript</b> functionality to a previous assignment</ul>
<ul>Use <b>JavaScript</b> to remove <i>elements</i> from the webpage</ul>

We've spent a lot of time working on some past projects and that hard work is something we can reuse. Let's return to the <i>Profile Page</i> assignment and add the types of <b>JavaScript</b> functionality we've previously learned onto it!
